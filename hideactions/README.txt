To demonstrate modifying an existing content type. We will hide the Action buttons, which include Save and Delete, on the Page content type if a User does not have the 'can click Actions' Permission. This means that while they can view the information they cannot save any changes. We will also add a field for a Change Request and a new button to submit that, which has a custom submit handler.
