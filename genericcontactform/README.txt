Generic Contact Form is an example of a custom module built using the Forms API. It displays a "contact us" form on the front end, with field validation. Form submissions are stored in a table, created when the module is enabled, and a copy of the information is emailed to the system admin.

@TODO
- allow form submissions to be viewed in drupal admin
- allow form submissions to be "updated" in some way, deleted
